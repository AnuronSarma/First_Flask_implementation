# Flask Application - My First Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains my first project using Flask, a micro web framework for Python. In this project, I explored various aspects of Flask, from setting up a basic app structure to building dynamic routes and integrating HTML forms. Below is a breakdown of my implementations and the learning steps.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Basic Flask App Setup
- **Initial Structure:** I set up a basic Flask application to run locally. The app includes essential routes and is configured for local development.
- **Home Page:** A basic route for the home page (`/home`).
- **Index Page:** Added another route for the index page (`/index`).

### 2. HTML Integration
- **HTML and Flask Forms:** I explored HTML tags and implemented my first form using HTML and Flask. This allowed user input, which was processed locally.
- **Conditional Statements and Loops:** I learned how to use for loops and if-else conditions in Flask and HTML to create dynamic content.

### 3. Dynamic URL for Exam Results
- **Dynamic Route Creation:** I created a dynamic URL route that displays students' results based on their marks. Depending on the input marks and the set pass marks, the app declares whether the student has passed or failed.
  
### 4. HTTP Methods Exploration
- **Flask Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE):** I explored and implemented different HTTP methods in Flask. This helped me understand how to handle various requests in the app.
  
### 5. "To Do List" Application
- **CRUD Operations:** I created a 'To Do List' where users can:
  - **Add** new items
  - **Delete** existing items
  - **Update** existing items

This allowed me to explore Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations within Flask.

### 6. Postman for API Testing
- **API Verification:** I used Postman to test and verify the functionality of the app, ensuring that all endpoints and HTTP methods were correctly implemented.
